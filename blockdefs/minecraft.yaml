# YAML Definition for the base Minecraft block types
#
# The library we're using apparently only supports YAML 1.1
# See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML or http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/
#
# The basic structure of the YAML file consists of a name (which describes
# the set of blocks), and then a big list of the blocks themselves, either
# defined by "blocks" or "mlblocks."
#
# When using "blocks", X-Ray requires you to specify textures in terms
# of their (X, Y) coordinates within minecraft's terrain.png file, with
# (0, 0) being the upper left.  Valid ranges for each coordinate is zero
# through fifteen.  For example, the bookshelf texture is (3, 2), and the
# birch sapling is (15, 4).
#
# Using "mlblocks" instead of "blocks" will allow you to specify texture
# information in a way useful for mods that use a ModLoader-style texture
# definition, where each block's texture is defined in a separate graphic
# file.  For this kind of block, wherever a coordinate is required, specify
# the filename instead.  Note that using "mlblocks" will require you to
# additionally specify a "texpath" entry at the top level (alongside "name")
# which specifies the root directory under which the textures can be found.
# For example, a definition file for Aethermod blocks would have a texpath
# of "aether/blocks", and its block 170 (Icestone) would have a "tex" value
# of "Icestone.png"
#
# Required fields for each block: id, idStr, name, mapcolor, tex
#
# Brief descriptions of the individual block fields:
#
#   id: The numeric ID of the block
#
#   idStr: A String ID of the block.  This is what you will use to
#          identify the block types in xray.properties, for instance,
#          to tell X-Ray which resources you're highlighting.  Most
#          of these are arbitrary and could be changed at will, but
#          a few are looked for specifically in the X-Ray code, and
#          so shouldn't be changed.  A complete list of the ones that
#          shouldn't be changed are:
#
#               COBBLESTONE (the LEVER renderer uses it)
#               FENCE / FENCE_GATE (their respective renderers use it)
#               IRON_BARS (the "solid pane" renderer uses it)
#               TORCH (the "explored" highlight uses it)
#               BEDROCK (the "bedrock" toggle uses it)
#               GRASS (the "grass rendering" toggle uses it)
#               SAPLING (some special data handling is needed)
#               PORTAL (we generate the texture to use for this one)
#               FIRE (we generate the texture to use for this one)
#               WATER (we do extra processing on the texture)
#               STATIONARY_WATER (we do extra processing on the texture)
#
#   name: The name that will show up in X-Ray if you're using it
#         as one of your highlights (unimportant otherwise)
#
#   mapcolor: RGB values for the minimap, 0-255
#
#   tex: The "main" (and possibly only) texture to use for this block type.
#        In "block" lists, this must be (X, Y) coordinates, and in "mlblock"
#        lists, this must be a filename.  There are four blocks which don't
#        require this element: FIRE, PORTAL, WATER, and STATIONARY_WATER.
#        Our textures for those blocks are specially generated by X-Ray.
#
#   tex_data: Sometimes blocks will change their texture based on
#        its data value; this will let you specify that.  For
#        examples, see Wood or Saplings.
#
#   tex_direction: Sometimes blocks have different textures on
#         different faces.  If some faces aren't specified, the
#         default "tex" will be used.  Note that "tex" is always
#         required, even if all directions are overridden.  Valid 
#         values are:
#             FORWARD
#             BACKWARD
#             SIDES
#             TOP
#             BOTTOM
#
#   tex_direction_data: By default, X-Ray will render "FORWARD"
#         as if it's facing North.  Sometimes the data value of
#         a block will determine which way it faces, though, and
#         this is where you can specify that.  For example, the
#         Dispenser's definition is:
#             {2: EAST, 3: WEST, 4: NORTH, 5: SOUTH}
#
#         Note that currently only NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, and EAST are
#         supported.  Presumably I should add in UP and DOWN as
#         well, but that's a feature for another day.
#
#   type: This determines how X-Ray will render the block.  The
#         default type is "NORMAL" which doesn't need to be specified.
#         Valid types are currently:
#
#             BED
#             BUTTON
#             CAKE
#             CROPS
#             DECORATION_CROSS
#             DOOR
#             FENCE
#             FLOOR
#             HALFHEIGHT
#             LADDER
#             LEVER
#             MINECART_TRACKS
#             NORMAL
#             PISTON_BODY
#             PISTON_HEAD
#             PORTAL
#             PRESSURE_PLATE
#             SEMISOLID
#             SIGNPOST
#             SIMPLE_RAIL
#             STAIRS
#             THINSLICE
#             TORCH
#             TRAPDOOR
#             WALLSIGN
#             WATER
#             VINE
#             HUGE_MUSHROOM
#             SOLID_PANE
#             CHEST
#
#         "SEMISOLID" refers to blocks which are cube-shaped but shouldn't
#         be considered fully solid by X-Ray's rendering engine.  Examples
#         are glass, lava, fire, and mob spawners.
#
#         "FLOOR" is currently only used for redstone wire, and might go
#         away once I actually get redstone wire rendering done.
#
#         "THINSLICE" is currently only used for snow, and I may eventually
#         change that to "SNOW" instead, and clean up that rendering.
