As mentioned on http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/ -

launch4j is free software licensed under the BSD license, the head subproject (the
code which is attached to the wrapped jars) is licensed under the MIT license.
Launch4j may be used for wrapping closed source, commercial applications. 

Additionally, launch4j (and thus this distribution) requires a couple of utilities
from the MinGW project, which appear to be under the GPLv2 license.  See "COPYING"
inside support/launch4j-dist/bin for more information on that.

All of the files redistributed here were taken from the launch4j 3.0.2 Linux
distribution.

The license for launch4j follows, and the license for "head" follows afterwards.
